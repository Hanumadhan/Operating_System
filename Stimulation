/*
Researchers designed one system that classified interactive and non interactive processes 
automatically by looking at the amount of terminal I/O. If a process did not input or output 
to the terminal in a 1-second interval, the process was classified as non interactive and was moved to a lower-priority queue. 
In response to this policy, one programmer modified his programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal 
at regular intervals of less than 1 second. The system gave his programs a high priority, even though the terminal 
output was completely meaningless.

There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process. Students are supposed to do their assignments 
and they need 3 things for that pen, paper and question paper. The teacher has an infinite supply of all the three things. 
One students has pen,an other has paper and another has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table 
and the student having the third complementary thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. 
The teacher then places another two things out of the three and again the student having the third thing makes 
the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. This cycle continues. WAP to synchronize the teacher and the students.
